## Introduction
This repo attempts to reproduce this amazing work by Kaiming He et al. :
[Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)

## TO-DO
- [x] Build network structure of 'res_nets_v1_50'
- [x] Restore pretrained model
    - [x] get var list to restore
- [x] Download COCO 2017 Dataset & Converting to TFRecoder
- [x] Use TFRecoder and tf.data API as input pipeline
- [x] Resnet_v1_50
- [ ] Dataset Preprocess
    - [ ] Random Flipping
    - [ ] 
- [ ] Anchor
    - [ ] Rewrite anchor.py in tensorflow
    - [x] Generator
    - [x] Convert [x_left,y_up] to the center of the anchor
    - [ ] Boundry Limitation
    - [x] IoU
        - [x] IoU test
    - [x] Sample 
        - [x] Rules
        - [x] 256 anchors sampled (Positive : Negative = 1 : 1)
            - [x] IoU > 0.7
            - [x] Anchor has the largest IoU with each gt_bbox
        - [ ] Speed Up
    - [ ] Regression Loss
    - [ ] Score Loss
- [ ] ROIalign

## Step
1. Download pretrained resnet50 model
```
cd data/
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz
tar -xzvf resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz
```
2. Compile and Install pycocotools
#To compile and install locally run "python setup.py build_ext --inplace"#
#To install library to Python site-packages run "python setup.py build_ext install"#

3. Download [COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download) dataset, place it into `./data`, then run `python download_and_convert_data.py` to build tf-records. It takes a while.
